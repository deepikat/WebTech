Welcome to the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. <br />
Welcome to the Web site of the USC Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, where you 
will find news and information about USC Dornsife during one of the most exciting periods in its history -a 
history that dates back to 1880.
The largest and oldest of the USC schools, USC Dornsife functions as the academic core of the university, 
offering courses and advancing knowledge across the humanities, social sciences and natural sciences.
For more than a decade, USC's undergraduate programs, centered in USC Dornsife, have consistently gained in 
stature. We see this both in a rise in average SAT scores and an increasing selectivity in admissions - in 2007 
USC Dornsife admitted 25 percent of the 17,650 student applicants, compared with 35.5 percent of 11,675 applicants 
in 2001.USC Dornsife offers undergraduates a choice of more than 60 majors and nearly 80 minors, and provides 
advisement to undecided and undeclared students. At the same time, we have initiated a concerted effort to 
strengthen USC Dornsife's graduate programs, which include 25 doctoral degree programs. USC Dornsife has reached 
its goal to recruit 100 world-class scholars, marking the close of a major initiative that in less than five years 
has led to a 25 percent expansion of our faculty.That increase has mirrored and helped catalyze the growth of USC 
Dornsife's research enterprise.Through institutional partnerships and service-learning programs, USC Dornsife has 
built strong alliances with the diverse communities of Southern California.

Every year, students from all over the world apply to USC.  We are proud to have one of the largest international 
student populations of any university in the United States.  We offer special international student orientations 
and a variety of student services to ease your transition to university life in the U.S.At USC, an international 
student is an individual of foreign nationality who will be entering, or has already entered, the United States 
with a student visa. Students already residing in the United States and holding other non-immigrant visas (E2, H2, 
or L2, for example) are also considered to be international students.International students do not qualify for 
need-based financial aid, but are eligible for merit-based scholarships. Permanent residents of the United States, 
naturalized U.S. citizens, and U.S. citizens residing abroad and attending school outside the United States are not 
considered international students and are eligible for both need-based financial aid and merit-based scholarships.

<p id="Fees & Funding" style="font-family:calibri; font-color:grey;">Fees & Funding <br/>
USC administers more than a dozen prestigious scholarship programs ranging up to full-tuition waivers. Unlike 
loans, scholarships do not have to be repaid. They are awarded based on academic excellence, leadership, service, 
talent, and the criteria detailed below. Recipients must enroll full time (16 units each semester) and maintain a 
cumulative GPA at USC of 3.0 or higher. If an interview is required, candidates will be contacted. Selection for an 
interview does not imply the awarding of a scholarship or admission to USC. Meeting application requirements and 
minimum criteria does not guarantee that you will be invited for a scholarship interview or receive a particular 
scholarship. Recipients of our scholarships often exceed the minimum criteria.

<p id="Botswana" style="font-family:calibri; font-color:grey;">Botswana <br/>
Botswana, officially the Republic of Botswana (Tswana: Lefatshe la Botswana), is a landlocked country located 
in Southern Africa. The citizens refer to themselves as "Batswana" (singular: Motswana). Formerly the British 
protectorate of Bechuanaland, Botswana adopted its new name after becoming independent within the Commonwealth 
on 30 September 1966. It has held uninterrupted democratic elections since independence.
Botswana is flat, and up to 70% is covered by the Kalahari Desert. It is bordered by South Africa to the south and 
southeast, Namibia to the west and north, and Zimbabwe to the northeast. Its border with Zambia to the north near 
Kazungula, Zambia is poorly defined but at most is a few hundred metres long.A mid-sized country of just over two 
million people, Botswana is one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world. Botswana was one of the 
poorest countries in Africa when it gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1966, with a GDP per capita of 
about US$70. Botswana has since transformed itself, becoming one of the fastest-growing economies in the world to a 
GDP (purchasing power parity) per capita of about $14,000, and a high gross national income, possibly the 
fourth-largest in Africa, giving the country a modest standard of living. The country also has a strong tradition 
as a representative democracy and has the second highest Human Development Index of continental Sub-Saharan 
African countries.

<p id="India" style="font-family:calibri; font-color:grey;">India<br/>
India, officially the Republic of India, is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, 
the second-most populous country with over 1.2 billion people, and the most populous democracy in the world. 
The earliest literary writings in India, composed between 1400 BCE and 1200 CE, were in the Sanskrit language.
Prominent works of this Sanskrit literature include epics such as the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, the dramas of 
Kalidasa such as the Abhijnanasakuntalam (The Recognition of sakuntala), and poetry such as the Mahakavya. Developed
 between 600 BCE and 300 CE in South India, the Sangam literature, consisting of 2,381 poems, is regarded as a 
 predecessor of Tamil literature. From the 14th to the 18th centuries, India's literary traditions went through a 
 period of drastic change because of the emergence of devotional poets such as Kabir, Tulsidas, and Guru Nanak.
 This period was characterised by a varied and wide spectrum of thought and expression; as a consequence, medieval 
 Indian literary works differed significantly from classical traditions.In the 19th century, Indian writers 
 took a new interest in social questions and psychological descriptions. In the 20th century, Indian literature was 
 influenced by the works of Bengali poet and novelist Rabindranath Tagore.
 Home to the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation and a region of historic trade routes and vast empires, the Indian 
 subcontinent was identified with its commercial and cultural wealth for much of its long history.Four world 
 religions—Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism—originated here, whereas Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and 
 Islam arrived in the 1st millennium CE and also helped shape the region's diverse culture. Gradually annexed by 
 and brought under the administration of the British East India Company from the early 18th century and 
 administered directly by the United Kingdom from the mid-19th century, India became an independent nation in 
 1947 after a struggle for independence that was marked by non-violent resistance led by Mahatma Gandhi.

<p id="Italy" style="font-family:calibri; font-color:grey;">Italy<br />
Italy, officially the Italian Republic (Italian: Repubblica italiana), 
is a unitary parliamentary republic in Southern Europe. To the north, Italy borders France, Switzerland, Austria, 
and Slovenia, and is approximately delimited by the Alpine watershed, enclosing the Po Valley and the Venetian Plain. 
To the south, it consists of the entirety of the Italian Peninsula and the two Mediterranean islands of Sicily and 
Sardinia, in addition to many smaller islands. The sovereign states of San Marino and the Vatican City are enclaves 
within Italy, while Campione d'Italia is an Italian exclave in Switzerland. Italy covers an area of 301,338 km2 
(116,347 sq mi) and has a largely temperate climate. With 60 million inhabitants, it is the fifth most populous 
country in Europe. Italy is also the fourth economic power of the European continent and the eighth of the world.
Italy's capital and largest city, Rome, has for centuries been the leading political and religious centre of 
Western civilisation, as the capital of the Roman Empire and of Christianity. In the Dark Ages, Italy suffered 
continual invasions by Germanic tribes, while the Roman heritage was preserved by Christian monks. Beginning from 
the 11th century, Italian cities rose to great prosperity through shipping, commerce and banking (modern 
capitalism, indeed, has its roots in Medieval Italy),while culture flourished especially during the 
Renaissance, with scholars, artists and polymaths such as Leonardo Da Vinci, Galileo, Michelangelo and Machiavelli. 
Nonetheless, Italy remained fragmented into numerous warring states for the rest of the Middle Ages, so it 
eventually fell prey to other big European nation-states, notably France, Spain and later Austria, entering a long 
period of decline which lasted until the beginning of the 18th century.
